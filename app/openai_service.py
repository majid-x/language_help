                1. Pronunciation: Are words pronounced correctly? Any specific words that need improvement?
                2. Rhythm/Pacing: Is the speech paced appropriately? Too fast, too slow, or uneven?
                3. Clarity: Is the speech clearly articulated and understandable?
                
                Provide numerical scores (1-10) for each aspect and specific feedback for improvement.
